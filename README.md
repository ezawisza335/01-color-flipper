# Project Title

This project is a guide to creating a webpage that generates a random color from the hexadecimal scale while interacting with a button while using a DOM.


## Setup

Much of the HTML has already been set up, and the CSS has been finished as well. 

[ ] Refer to the index.html to add the basic structure of the webpage.

## Objective

[ ] Add functionality to the app.js page so the button chooses a color from the object.

[ ] Add functionality to the hex.js page so the button changes the background color to a random combination of hexadecimal characters.
